# SketchUp-IFC-Manager
## IFC data manager and exporter for SketchUp.
SketchUp-IFC-Manager is an extension that helps you to add more useful information to IFC models created with SketchUp.. It’s created around the dutch “BIM basis ILS” (English: [BIM basic IDM](http://www.bimloket.nl/upload/documents/downloads/BIMbasisILS/BIM%20basic%20IDM%20(A4).pdf)) initiative that tries to achieve a basic Information delivery specification for the dutch building industry (http://www.bimloket.nl/BIMbasisILS)

### Make sure you are using SketchUp PRO version 2016 or 2017!
The new 2018 version of SketchUp contains a bug that breaks the ability to export to IFC from extensions.
Rendering this extension useless untill the SketchUp team fizes the bug or I finish the next version, let's see who's first ;-)
