# SketchUp-IFC-Manager
## IFC data manager and exporter for SketchUp.
SketchUp-IFC-Manager is an extension that helps you to add more useful information to IFC models created with SketchUp.. It’s created around the dutch “BIM basis ILS” (English: [BIM basic IDM](http://www.bimloket.nl/upload/documents/downloads/BIMbasisILS/BIM%20basic%20IDM%20(A4).pdf)) initiative that tries to achieve a basic Information delivery specification for the dutch building industry (http://www.bimloket.nl/BIMbasisILS)
